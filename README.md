# Challenge-Week-1

## Description

This webpage demonstrates my work during our Challenge Week 1 assignment which had to do with refactoring HTML and CSS code. Originally, I was given a set of starter code with the intention of refactoring HTML code and consolodating repeated CSS style rules. The objective was to simplify the code and make it more accessible while also maintaining the structure and style of the webpage to users. 

## What did I Refactor?

To accomplish the objectives of the Challenge Week 1 Assignment I first updated the HTML "div class=header" and "div class=footer" elements to their respective semantic elements. I also updated the side panel information under a semantic "aside" tag. Next, I consolodated many of the repeating CSS style rules for matching header and section elements with the same rules specified. Then, I returned to the HTML code and added descriptive "alt" tags to the images and icons to make them more accessible to screen readers, etc. 

For a further breakdown of what was refactored you can refer to the comments on the CSS style sheet that were added to explain each unique change to the starter code. 

## What adversity did I face during this Web App Design / Refactoring?

1. During this Challenge I had a lot of fun just diving into the starter code and playing around with it. Initially, I was afraid to change anything because I didn't want to entirely break the code while refactoring it and not know how to restore it back to the original state without completely restarting the assignment. I am still uncertain if it would be best to just commit changes consistently to the main branch as I go, or if I should create a feature branch with my assignment changes to the starter code and merge that branch in later. For now, I just made the adjustments slowly on my local machine to ensure I didn't entirely ruin the code and make it unusable. 

2. When I began the challenge assignment I didn't understand that we were supposed to clone the repository from "urban-octo-telegram", so what I did was created a new Github repo, cloned it to my local machine, and later copy/pasted the starter code and assets from the Gitlab U-of-M repo, and pushed those changes up to the repo I created for the assignment. After reading through the material in Bootcamp spot later on - I realized that I completely screwed up that process. Additionally, when trying to push future changes up to that repository I created I encountered a "fatal: could not read from remote repository - port 22: connection timed out" and I was unable to understand how to reconnect my repo to my local machine because neither SSH or HTTP was working. I ended up furthering the damage by cloning my repo into the same repo and creating what I learned was a "submodule". Inevitably, I had to create another new "retry" repository to push my final draft up for grading. 

3. Though the difficulty and misunderstanding with my repository was frustrating and I still don't know the "why" behind what I experienced; I am still grateful because I have several very interesting questions to ask my Instructor / TAs and I know that will lead to valuable insight and learning opportunities. Still, I wanted to spend more time focusing on the refactoring because I know there was more cleaning up that I could've done, but ultimately toward the end of the week most of my time was spent trying to understand the issues I was facing with my Repo itself. 

Better luck next time :)
