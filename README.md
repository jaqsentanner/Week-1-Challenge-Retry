# Challenge-Week-1

## Description

This webpage demonstrates my work during our Challenge Week 1 assignment which had to do with refactoring HTML and CSS code. Originally, I was given a set of starter code with the intention of refactoring HTML code and consolodating repeated CSS style rules. The objective was to simplify the code and make it more accessible while also maintaining the structure and style of the webpage to users. 

## What did I refactor?

To accomplish the objectives of the Challenge Week 1 Assignment I first updated the HTML "div class=header" and "div class=footer" elements to their respective semantic elements. I also updated the side panel information under a semantic "aside" tag. Next, I consolodated many of the repeating CSS style rules for matching header and section elements with the same rules specified. Then, I returned to the HTML code and added descriptive "alt" tags to the images and icons to make them more accessible to screen readers, etc. 

For a further breakdown of what was refactored you can refer to the comments on the CSS style sheet that were added to explain each unique change to the starter code.
